# ECE350 ToolChain Installation for Mac
## Quick Start
To run, double click on the setup.command file. Installation takes ~5 minutes to complete and may require your password to install some components. The script installs the following:
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Homebrew
- OpenOCD
- USB FTDI Drivers
- Icarus Verilog 
- GTKWave

The repository includes a linter file for use with VSCode's popular Verilog extension. It is not automatically installed by the setup file, but the details are described below. 


If you wish to install the software yourself, follow the instructions below.

## Optional - Linter
If you use VSCode, the [most popular Verilog extension in the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mshr-h.VerilogHDL) doesn't use the format that we use in the course to organize our files. If you wish to replace the linter file that comes with the that extension, you can do so by replacing the linter file with the following command, run from within the toolchain repository. 

1. Install [the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mshr-h.VerilogHDL)
2. In a terminal window from within the Toolchain directory, enter 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`find ~/.vscode/extensions -name "mshr-h.veriloghdl-*" -exec cp IcarusLinter.js '{}'/out/src/linter/IcarusLinter.js \;`

Note: This linter uses the general flow of how we teach you to use Icarus. You will need to create you file list and name it "FileList.txt" for this linter to work.
